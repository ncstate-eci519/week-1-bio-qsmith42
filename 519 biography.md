## About Me
Hi! My name is Quaneisha Smith.  I'm a first-year student in the **Learning Design and Technology M.Ed. Program**.  I'm a second-grade teacher in the [Wake County Public School System](https://www.wcpss.net).  I currently teach at [Herbert Akins Road Elementary School](https://www.wcpss.net/herbertakinsroades) in Fuquay-Varina.  I also reside in Fuquay-Varina with my husband and two sons. During my very limited spare time, I enjoy shopping, watching movies, reading inspirational books, attending church, and taking vacations.
